As you can see you have an mysql pod in a bad state.
<br>
The objective is to fix this pod, good start would be describing the pod
<br>
RUN `k describe pod nginx`
<br>
Maybe next try lookiong at the logs
<br>
RUN `k logs mysql`
<br>
Now fix it!!!
<br>
Once you have it running click on 
***CHECK***
to get the flag
